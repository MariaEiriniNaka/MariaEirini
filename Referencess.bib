	abstract = {Objectives: There is a controversy about the impact of economic crisis on suicide rates in Greece. We analysed recent suicide data to identify who has been most affected and the relationships to economic and labour market indicators. Setting: Greece. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Agespecific and sex-specific suicide rates in Greece for the period 2003–2012 were calculated using data provided by the Hellenic Statistical Authority. We performed a join-point analysis to identify discontinuities in suicide trends between 2003 and 2010, prior to austerity, and in 2011–2012, during the period of austerity. Regression models were used to assess relationships between unemployment, Gross Domestic Product ({GDP}) and suicide rates for the entire period by age and sex.
Results: The mean suicide rate overall rose by 35\% between 2010 and 2012, from 3.37 to 4.56/100 000 population. The suicide mortality rate for men increased from 5.75 (2003–2010) to 7.43/100 000 (2011–2012; p{\textless}0.01). Among women, the suicide rate also rose, albeit less markedly, from 1.17 to 1.55 (p=0.03). When differentiated by age group, suicide mortality increased among both sexes in the age groups 20–59 and {\textgreater}60 years. We found that each additional percentage point of unemployment was associated with a 0.19/ 100 000 population rise in suicides (95\% {CI} 0.11 to 0.26) among working age men.
Conclusions: We found a clear increase in suicides among persons of working age, coinciding with austerity measures. These findings corroborate concerns that increased suicide risk in Greece is a health hazard associated with austerity measures.},

	abstract = {Background: Although Internet has become an important source for affected people seeking suicide information, the connection between Internet searches for suicide information and suicidal death remains largely unknown. This study aims to evaluate the association between suicide and Internet searches trends for 37 suicide-related terms representing major known risks of suicide.
Methods: This study analyzes suicide death data in Taipei City, Taiwan and corresponding local Internet search trend data provided by Google Insights for Search during the period from January 2004 to December 2009. The investigation uses cross correlation analysis to estimate the temporal relationship between suicide and Internet search trends and multiple linear regression analysis to identify significant factors associated with suicide from a pool of search trend data that either coincides or precedes the suicide death.
Results: Results show that a set of suicide-related search terms, the trends of which either temporally coincided or preceded trends of suicide data, were associated with suicide death. These search factors varied among different suicide samples. Searches for “major depression” and “divorce” accounted for, at most, 30.2\% of the variance in suicide data. When considering only leading suicide trends, searches for “divorce” and the pro-suicide term “complete guide of suicide,” accounted for 22.7\% of variance in suicide data.
Conclusions: Appropriate filtering and detection of potentially harmful source in keyword-driven search results by search engine providers may be a reasonable strategy to reduce suicide deaths. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent research in Japan and Taiwan has found that the volume of Internet searches each month on Google for suicide-related terms is sometimes associated with the monthly suicide rate. The present study sought to examine whether this association between suicide rates and Google searches for suicide are found over regions.
Methods
Suicide rates in the state of America in 2009 were examined for their association with search volume on Google for “commit suicide,” “how to suicide” and “suicide prevention.”
Results
Suicide rates for the 50 American states were positively associated with the search volume for all three terms.
Conclusions
Internet searches for suicide may provide a faster way of monitoring possible trends in suicide than waiting for central governments to compile suicide statistics.},

	abstract = {Background
There is widespread concern regarding the possible influence of the Internet on suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of Internet-related suicide in England.
Methods
Cross sectional study based on detailed review of the inquest reports of suicides occurring in the areas served by 12 Coroners in England. Evidence of Internet use in relation to the suicide was sought for each death.
Results
Altogether inquest reports for 593 suicides (all methods) in 2005 and 166 suicides using specific methods in 2006–7 were assessed. There was evidence of a direct Internet contribution in nine (1.5\% 95\%{CI} 0.7 to 2.9\%) of the 593 suicides in 2005. In seven (77.8\%) of the cases the individuals had used the Internet to research the methods of suicide they used. Five (55.6\%) individuals had used ‘unusual’ high-lethality methods, whereas such methods were only used in 1.7\% of all suicides (p{\textless}0.001). There was evidence of Internet involvement in 2.4\% (0.7\% to 6.1\%) of the suicides in 2006–2007. None of the Internet-related suicides appeared to occur as part of a suicide pact.
Limitations
The contribution of the Internet to suicide rates may be under-estimated in this analysis as Coroners are unlikely to comprehensively pursue the possibility of Internet involvement in all the deaths they investigate.
Conclusions
Easy access to information about suicide methods and pro-suicide web sites on the Internet appears to contribute to a small but significant proportion of suicides. A key impact of the Internet appears to be in relation to information concerning suicide methods.},
